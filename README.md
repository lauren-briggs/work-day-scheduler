Week 05 Homework - simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.



//To do:
- Add current day at top of calendar

- Change colour of block to show past/present/future
- Make timeblocks text areas for user input
- Add save/submit button
- Save to local storage
- Save/print user input on timeblock
- Add link and screenshot of live site


// Created a variable in js to link to the currentDay in the HTML DOM

// Created a function to use moment.js to display the current day and date in currentDayEl. Used the format dddd, Do MMMM to show Saturday, 27th March. Used .append() to insert this text into the HTML.
